Steps to run LAMP server:

Now, create a project directory ~/docker/lamp (letâ€™s say) and a html/ directory inside the project directory for keeping the website files (i.e. php, html, css, js etc.) as follows:

$ mkdir -p ~/docker/lamp/html


Now, navigate to the project directory ~/docker/lamp as follows:

$ cd ~/docker/lamp


Create a php.Dockerfile in the project directory ~/docker/lamp. This is a Dockerfile which enables mysqli and PDO php extensions in the php:7.4.3-apache image from Docker Hub and builds a custom Docker image from it.

The contents of the php.Dockerfile is given below.

FROM php:7.4.3-apache
RUN docker-php-ext-install mysqli pdo pdo_mysql

Now, create a docker-compose.yaml file in the project directory ~/docker/lamp and type in the following lines in the docker-compose.yaml file.

version: "3.7"
services:
  web-server:
    build:
      dockerfile: php.Dockerfile
      context: .
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - "./html/:/var/www/html/"
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
  mysql-server:
    image: mysql:8.0.19
    restart: always
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: secret
    volumes:
      - mysql-data:/var/lib/mysql

  phpmyadmin:
    image: phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin:5.0.1
    restart: always
    environment:
      PMA_HOST: mysql-server
      PMA_USER: root
      PMA_PASSWORD: secret
    ports:
      - "5000:80"
volumes:
  mysql-data:



Also, create a index.php file in the html/ directory for testing the LAMP server.

The contents of the index.php file in my case,

<?php
$host = "mysql-server";
$user = "root";
$pass = "secret";
$db = "app1";
try {
    $conn = new PDO("mysql:host=$host;dbname=$db", $user, $pass);
    $conn->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);
 
    echo "Connected successfully";
} catch(PDOException $e) {
    echo "Connection failed: " . $e->getMessage();
}
?>


Now in root folder, run docker-compose up -d

To see how the ports are mapped, run the following command:

$ docker-compose ps


Now, In port 5000 you can able to access LAMP server and in port 8080 you can able to see "Connected successfully"

LAMP server setup was done.
